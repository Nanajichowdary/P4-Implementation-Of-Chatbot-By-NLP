## Implementation-of-ChatBot-by-NLP
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple NLP-based chatbot using Python. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to understand user queries and provide appropriate responses. The chatbot is trained on custom intents and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
## Features
Predefined intents with user patterns and bot responses.

TF-IDF vectorization of user input.

Logistic Regression classifier for intent prediction.

Real-time interaction via Streamlit UI.

Easy to extend by adding more intents and patterns.
## Technologies Used
Python 3

NLTK for text tokenization.

Scikit-learn for machine learning (TF-IDF and Logistic Regression).

Streamlit for building the web interface.
## How It Works
Define Intents: Custom intents are defined with example patterns and corresponding responses.

Preprocessing: Tokenization and vectorization using TF-IDF.

Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained to classify user input based on defined intents.

Chat Function: Matches user input to the predicted intent and selects a random response from that category.

Streamlit Deployment: Launches a web interface where users can type messages and receive chatbot responses.
## UI Preview
Streamlit UI allows typing messages like "Hi", "What is a credit score?", or "Thanks", and the bot responds accordingly.
## Run Locally
1. Clone the repository

## Sample Intents
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "tag": "greeting",
  "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
  "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
}
Other tags include: goodbye, thanks, about, help, age, weather, budget, credit_score.

## Requirements
You can include this in your requirements.txt:

## Future Improvements
Add real-time data support (e.g., weather APIs).

Integrate with speech recognition.

Enable context-aware conversations.

Add database-backed chat history.
